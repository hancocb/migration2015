 <b>How does Calibration work?</b>
 <p>Since CNs are defined by landuse and
HSG, the relationships between CNs need to be maintained. For instance, CNs for
urban are typically greater than forest, and CNs for HSG A are smaller than HSG
D for a given landuse. One approach to calibrate CNs is to multiply default CNs
by an identical fraction (or percentage, Fr<sub>cn</sub> in Equation 5.8); in
other words, CNs are increased or decreased by an identical percentage. Annual
shallow groundwater is computed based on the soil infiltration fractions for
precipitation which are defined by landuse and HSG. Therefore, the soil
infiltration fractions for precipitation can be calibrated by the approach used
for calibrating CNs. The pollutant coefficients are defined by landuse, and the
calibration approach can be applied (Fr<sub>nt,1</sub> for N, Fr<sub>nt,2</sub>
for P, and Fr<sub>nt,3</sub> for BOD in Equation 5.9). USLE factors are defined
by landuses in STEPL WEB, with factors based on those from the EPA STEPL
database. Since sediment loads are computed by multiplying soil erosion (USLE
factors) and SDR, sediment loads can be calibrated by SDR calibration rather
than by individual USLE factors (Park et al., 2010); the fraction in equations
10 and 11 is calibrated for annual sediment load. The fraction is multiplied by
SDR, which also implies that USLE factors for soil erosion are increased or
decreased by an identical fraction.</p>
